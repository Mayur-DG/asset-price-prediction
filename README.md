## ML Models for Bond Price Prediction

This project uses six machine learning methods to predict USA 10-year bond prices:

- **rf.py**: Random Forest implementation  
- **svr.py**: Support Vector Regression implementation  
- **linreg.py**: Linear Regression implementation  
- **kerasmlp.py**: Neural Network implementation  
- **modelrnn.py**: Recurrent Neural Network implementation  
- **modellstm.py**: LSTM implementation  

The data is scraped using pandas from the FRED database. The applications of this project can be applied to fields such as commodities trading, fx markets and equity markets with varying liquidity and higher risk.
